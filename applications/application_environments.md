# Application Environments

There are a handful (and growing) choices you have to pick from when it comes to the application environment. Picking the right one is a combination of compatibility & the costs.

You can deploy the application using the following widely available technologies:
* Virtual Machines (Full operating system install)
* Containers (Isolate the application into separate virtual environments)
* App Engine (Use the provider native's predefined application environment)
